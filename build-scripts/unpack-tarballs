# BE CAREFUL!
# This script will delete your CFEngine repositories if you are running it locally.
#
# Normally you would run autogen script first:
#   $ PROJECT=community ./buildscripts/build-scripts/autogen
#
# Then build tarballs with something like:
#   $ BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ./buildscripts/build-scripts/bootstrap-tarballs
#
# This will create three tarballs:
# $ tree output/tarballs/
# output/tarballs/
# ├── cfengine-3.27.0a.55f1c495f.tar.gz
# ├── cfengine-masterfiles-3.27.0a.2655c7b89-1.pkg.tar.gz
# ├── cfengine-masterfiles-3.27.0a.2655c7b89.tar.gz
# └── sha256sums.61691.txt
#
# 1 directory, 4 files
#
# Then you can unpack these tarballs with this script:
#   $ PROJECT=community ./buildscripts/build-scripts/unpack-tarballs
#

. "$(dirname "$0")"/functions
. detect-environment
. compile-options
